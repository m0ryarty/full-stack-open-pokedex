Among the available programming languages, Python is one of those with the greatest community support. This results in a multitude of libraries and information for the most varied tasks, facilitating and boosting systems development.
Some of these tools are more popular, which makes them the common choice for many projects.
When it comes to carrying out testing, which is often neglected by developers, the Python environment had Pytest, which is widely customizable according to the complexity that the project acquires.
One of the common terms in the Python environment is the term pythonic. To acquire this seal, you must at least follow the recommendations in the PEP8 guide. However PEP8 is just a set of recommendations, it is possible to go further.
That's what the black library does. Its adherence to PEP8 is not complete, but, precisely because it expands these rules, it ends up being a good choice for obtaining clean and readable code in Python.
As its maintenance and learning are simplified, it ends up helping the programmer when writing accurately.
Having the code tested and readable, without the need to transpile the code to deliver it to production, the libraries mentioned make the work easier.
